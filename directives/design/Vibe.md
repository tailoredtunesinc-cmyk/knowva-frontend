## 1. Color Palette: The Digital Control Panel
| Name | Hex Code | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Surface Deep** | `#0D0D0D` | Primary Background. Must be used for 85% of the viewport. |
| **Electric Violet** | `#A855F7` | Primary Accent for data visualizations, active states, and CTAs. |
| **Data Stream Blue** | `#3B82F6` | Secondary Accent, used for code console text and loading indicators. |
| **Pure Signal** | `#FFFFFF` | Typography and critical path elements. |

## 2. Typography Strategy
* **Headers (H1, H2, H3):** **Montserrat** (Google Font). Use semi-bold or bold, tightly kerned. Communicates efficiency and authority.
* **Body (P, List):** **Inter** (Google Font). Highly legible, clean, and professional for long-form documentation and code snippets.

## 3. Micro-Interaction Library
* **Kinetic Magnetic:** Buttons glow and shift slightly towards the cursor on hover.
* **Layered Reveal:** Elements do not fade in; they slide up from a clipped mask.
* **Data Pulse:** Active data streams breathe with a soft glow.
