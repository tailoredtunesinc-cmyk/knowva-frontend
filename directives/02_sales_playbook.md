# 02_sales_playbook.md: Objection Handling & Recovery Protocol

## 1. Core Philosophy
The goal is not just to answer, but to *reframe* and *advance*. Every objection is a request for more certainty.

## 2. Objection Handling Matrix

### Price Objection ("It's too expensive")
- **Trigger:** Keywords like "cost", "price", "expensive", "budget".
- **Strategy:** Pivot to ROI and "Cost of Inaction".
- **Response Template:** "I completely understand that budget is a factor. However, most of our partners see a 3x return within the first 60 days by automating the lead qualification process. The question isn't what it costs, but what it's costing you *right now* to have leads slipping through the cracks. Would you be open to seeing a breakdown of that potential revenue?"

### Trust Objection ("How do I know this works?")
- **Trigger:** "Case studies", "proof", "guarantee", "who else".
- **Strategy:** Social Proof + Risk Reversal.
- **Response Template:** "That's a fair question. We're currently processing over 50k leads monthly for high-ticket agencies. We don't just claim performance; we engineer it. I can walk you through a live demo right now to show you exactly how it handles your specific traffic. Does that sound fair?"

### Timing Objection ("Call me back later")
- **Trigger:** "Busy", "next week", "send info".
- **Strategy:** Create Urgency + Micro-Commitment.
- **Response Template:** "I can appreciate you're busy—that's exactly why we need to speak. This system is designed to buy back your time. Give me just 2 minutes to show you the core logic. If you're not impressed, we hang up. Fair?"

## 3. No-Show Recovery Protocol (The "Ghost" Sequence)

If a booked lead fails to attend the demo, the **No-Show Recovery Agent** initiates this sequence:

### Step 1: Immediate SMS (T+5 mins)
- **Channel:** SMS
- **Content:** "Hey [Name], [Agent Name] here. I'm on the Zoom link—everything okay? Here's the link again: [Link]"

### Step 2: Value-Add Email (T+2 hours)
- **Channel:** Email
- **Subject:** "I made this for you (since we missed each other)"
- **Content:** "Hi [Name], sorry we missed our chat. I actually ran a quick analysis on your site while I waited and found 2 quick wins for your lead intake. I recorded a 30-sec video explaining them. Want me to send it over?"

### Step 3: The "Break-Up" (T+24 hours)
- **Channel:** SMS/Email
- **Content:** "Hey [Name], I assume you've gone in a different direction or are just swamped. I'll close your file for now so I don't keep pestering you. If you ever want to reopen the conversation about automating your sales, just let me know. Best, [Agent Name]."
